PATRICK:

I don't need water!

173
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,719
Water's for quitters!

174
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,719
I don't need it.

I don't need it.

I don't need it,
I don't need it.

178
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:19,929
Why, these flowers
are just beautiful.

179
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,929
They'll live much, much longer

in a vase full
of ice-cold water.

So tell me about yourself.

00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,740
It must be fascinating
being a sea critter.

SpongeBob?

Oh, there's the cookies.

00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,980
Be right back.

You can't leave now.

You'll blow it.

Air is not good, Patrick.

Air is not good.

You're just being shy.

207

Don't worry, buddy.

208
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,809
You're doing fine.

We got to get out of here!

You're doing it wrong.

If you all needed water,
you should have asked.
