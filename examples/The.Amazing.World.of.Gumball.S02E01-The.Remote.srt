1
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,540
Tonight is going to be awesome

2
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,460
I can't believe they're going to show it!

3
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,460
TV is finally gonna
acknowledge our existence.

4
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:24,940
What are you talking about?

5
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,860
-Only<i> Cutey Pets.</i>
-The number-one pet show on TV.

6
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,460
They're gonna show this photo!

7
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,700
Pet? I thought you preferred
<i>Animal Companions?</i>

8
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,380
Oh, who cares about moral principles?
This is TV we're talking about!

9
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,140
I'm pretty excited, too.

10
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,180
<i>Win Or Don't Win </i>is calling tonight.

11
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,820
All I have to do is answer one question
and I'll win a new microwave.

12
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,660
What's wrong with our microwave?

13
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,620
Yeah, that makes sense.

14
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,660
Well, I can't wait to watch<i> Daisy </i>tonight.

15
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,580
You're going to meet Sally the snake,
aren't you, Daisy?

16
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,020
Yes, I am.

17
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,020
[sighs] I can't wait till 8:00.

18
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:04,580
Well, then I guess
it's whoever gets to the remote first!

19
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:20,020
Uh-bup-bup-bup! I've been up all night
saving my seat for...

20
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,060
[in Spanish] The great ending
of<i> Sorrow Street.</i>

21
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,220
[in English] And just to make sure

22
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,140
no one changes the channel,
I've hidden the remote!

23
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,380
Can I please watch<i> Daisy?</i>

24
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,500
-No!
-No!

25
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,300
This face was made for TV!

26
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,620
I don't want to grow a third arm
next time I make a cup of coffee!

27
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,900
I wish I had enough money
to buy my own remote!

28
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,380
OK, well, you know what?

29
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,980
I'm going... grocery shopping!

30
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,940
Hey! We're not done with you yet.

31
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,460
Wake up!

32
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,100
Wait a minute. We don't need the remote.

33
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,700
We can change the channel on the TV.

34
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,820
[gasps] You mean get up from the sofa
and change it manually,

35
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,660
like they did in ancient times
when people weren't lazy?

36
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,780
That sounds a little extreme, man.

37
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,340
[Gumball] Check, check.

38
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,740
OK, control, I'm going in.
[mimicking radio signal]

39
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,300
[Darwin] OK. [mimicking radio signal]

40
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,780
How you feeling?

41
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,060
[Gumball]
To be honest, I'm feeling pretty lazy.

42
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,860
[Darwin mimicking radio signal]
Keep going. You're doing great.

43
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,100
Something's happening.

44
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,860
It's like,
no one's ever walked here before.

45
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,020
I... I... I can't do it.

46
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,580
-I'm gonna turn around!
-[Darwin] No!

47
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,820
You've got to keep going!

48
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,340
You've passed the Christmas carpet stain.

49
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,380
There won't be enough willpower
to send you back.

50
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,260
OK. I'll try.

51
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,260
[grunts] Gravity pulling me down!

52
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,180
I'm not gonna make it!

53
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,940
I... can't... be...

54
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,860
bothered!

55
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,380
Abort the mission!
I repeat, abort the mission!

56
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,980
I'm sorry, buddy, but it wasn't possible.

57
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,380
Now I know why remotes were invented.

58
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,700
Here, take this.
It'll make you feel better.

59
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,620
Did I hear chocolate?

60
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,180
Yes.

61
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,740
And we'll give you some
when you tell us where the remote is!

62
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,140
-No! Never!
-Oh, really?

63
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,340
Not even for the chocolate
choo-choo train?

64
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,540
I'll get it!

65
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,260
{\an8}Anais, I need you to tell me
what brand the TV is.

66
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,340
{\an8}OK. But does this mean
I can watch<i> Daisy </i>tonight?

67
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,740
{\an8}No, it means you won't be grounded
for six months.

68
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,340
{\an8}What? But I'm four!

69
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,180
{\an8}That's like one-eight of my life!

70
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,540
{\an8}Then you don't want
to spend it locked up in your bedroom.

71
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,420
{\an8}[grunts] Fine!

72
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,940
The train will not be stopping
at this mouth.

73
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,060
OK! OK!

74
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,380
Just give me the chocolate,
and I'll tell you!

75
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,620
-Yes!
-Yes!

76
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:25,140
[sighs] But in the form of a riddle.

77
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,340
The remote is in the valley
betwixt two hills.

78
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,540
It's name begins with a "B,"

79
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:35,220
ends with two T's,
and has "U" in the middle.

80
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,700
And you'll never find it! [laughing]

81
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,700
I know this one! I know this one!

82
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,580
Dude, there's no remote here.

83
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,820
Hmm. Wait a minute.

84
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,020
B-U-T-T.

85
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,580
It's under his butt, isn't it?

86
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,140
-[door opens]
-I got him! Get the remote!

87
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,500
[gasps] Where is it?
I've been sitting on it all day long!

88
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,620
There's only one person
that could have taken it.

89
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,220
Yeah! You!
Because it definitely wasn't me!

90
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,420
Where did you put it?

91
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,380
Where did you put it?
Where did you put it?

92
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,180
Dude, say it, don't spray it!

93
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,540
Tell him where it is!

94
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,100
-Tell him where it is now!
-Where did you put it?

95
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,580
Chill, everybody!

96
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,140
I meant Anais. It could only be Anais.

97
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,580
Oh... 'Cause we both want to watch
the same thing.

98
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,940
Yeah, right.

99
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,100
Get her!

100
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,300
[all three] Where's the remote?

101
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,780
-What remote?
-Right!

102
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,580
{\an8}What are you doing?

103
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,260
{\an8}Look! The scissors
she used to cut a hole in the sofa.

104
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,940
{\an8}What are you talking about?

105
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:56,259
{\an8}Tell us where it is!

106
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,259
{\an8}Or Daisy won't have to worry
about headaches ever again.

107
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,420
{\an8}No, please! Wait!

108
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:04,980
{\an8}Here it is.

109
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,220
{\an8}I'm sorry.

110
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,860
But I just want you to know...

111
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,779
I'm doing this for your own good!

112
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:18,180
No...

113
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,820
-All right, Daisy's getting it.
-No.

114
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,580
There is another.

115
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,020
-Another what?
-Another remote.

116
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,820
Mom went downtown to buy one.

117
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,500
[gasp] It's 20 to 8:00!

118
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,940
{\an8}We need to get that remote!

119
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,660
{\an8}-Thanks for the tip!
-Daisy!

120
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,580
{\an8}Oh, yeah.

121
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,580
{\an8}Wait. You're not coming?

122
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:47,020
{\an8}I don't care about your stupid TV anymore!

123
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,660
All I need is my Daisy.

124
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,420
Gotcha.

125
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,020
Get her!

126
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,020
Get the remote!

127
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,540
Looking for these?

128
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,900
Thank you.

129
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,420
No!

130
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:50,340
[in Spanish] I've got to know if Consuelo
survives the pressure.

131
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,180
[in English] She's gaining on us!

132
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,660
-That remote is mine!
-Then come and get it!

133

Let's take the stairs.

134
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,140
She's getting away!

135
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,300
If you leave without paying,

136
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,380
you're setting a bad example
for your children!

137
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,580
I can't find the right change!

138
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,060
Oh, no.

139
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:48,980
Come on.

140
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,060
Thank you for being a responsible citizen.

-Wait a minute!
-That's mine! Hey!

149
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,060
This isn't a TV remote.

150
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,180
Why?

00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,260
My car!

-What did you buy this for?
-What?

154
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,140
It's the one Anais told me to get.

155
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,540
Why would Anais tell you
to buy the wrong...

remote?

157
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,700
She planned this whole thing
from the start.

00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,140
{\an8}[Nicole]<i> So, when I called, she must have</i>
<i>given me the name of a garage-door opener.</i>

161
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,220
{\an8}Fine. Let me have a look.

162
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,220
{\an8}-It's a Logikar 2000.
-Thanks, honey.

<i>-</i>[Richard]<i> She overheard my riddle...</i>
-I know this one!

164
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,260
[Richard]<i> ...waited till you guys</i>
<i>were at Butt Valley</i>

165
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:05,620
<i>and cut a hole in the sofa</i>
<i>so she could take the real remote.</i>

166
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,340
[Nicole]<i> And the remote she smashed</i>
<i>upstairs must have been a decoy.</i>

167
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,340
Which means the real one
must still be in the house.

168
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,540
[gasps] I had it in my hands.

169
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,740
{\an8}-[Gumball] Thanks for the tip.
-Daisy!

170
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,300
{\an8}Oh, yeah.

171
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,860
All I need is my Daisy.

176
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,980
I feel so proud of her,
yet really scared at the same time.

177
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,380
-No!
-No!
