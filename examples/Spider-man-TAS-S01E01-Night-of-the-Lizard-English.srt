1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,270
New York City.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,780
If only everything down there
was really as peaceful

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,020
as it looks from up here.

4
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,150
Yeah, hold it right there!

5
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,280
Yeah ! Like I was saying,
you're gonna love working down here.

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,570
It's cool in the summer
and warm in the winter.

7
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,330
And uh, no office politics.

8
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,400
That sounds better than my last job,
I was in the television business.

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,980
TV?! Really!

10
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,130
Hey, my old TV gets these double
images, you know what I mean?

11
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,300
Hey maybe you could...

12
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,860
No, I was a TV executive.

13
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,010
Oh, hey you're better off down here.

14
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:49,130
Holy...

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,450
Wait it's got me! What?! Help!

16
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,870
Help!

17
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,430
Those eyes, they're after me!

18
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:24,750
What's this?!

19
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,420
Another satisfied graduated

20
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,420
of the New York City
cab driving academy?

21
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,120
Hit the brake!

22
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,380
Turn! Turn!

23
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:51,670

25
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,040
What was that all about?

26
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,130
The red eyes!
The red eyes they're after me!

27
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:54,320
Uh-uh... And did they belong
to little pink elephants?

28
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,920
No. Mister it was real!
It was real! I swear!

29
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,940
Yeah alright, fine!

30
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,320
Just don't let the cops
blame this one on me okay?

31
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,470
The red eyes... The red eyes!

32
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,320
Sure pal, whatever you say!

33
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,860
New York City, never a dull moment!

34
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,580
Well, guess it all goes with the job.

35
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,720
Peter, I have a new job for you.

36
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,370
You've always gotten
good shots of Spiderman, right?

37
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,610
Let's see
what you can do with the Lizard.

38
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,940
- The who?
<i>- The Lizard, Parker.</i>

39
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,090
If you'd ever get here on time,
maybe you'd know what was going on.

40
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,400
There've been reports
of a giant lizard down in the subways.

41
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,700
- In this town, who'd notice?
<i>- I'd notice...</i>

42
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,830
If this weren't serious Parker,
I wouldn't have gotten the assignment.

43
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,190
I don't know about that Brock,

44
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,850
you're just a reporter
I'd send in a wild goose chase.

45
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,090
It's not a wild goose chase,
smart mouth.

46
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,380
Look. Subway repairman. Missing.

47
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,390
His friend says the Lizard got him.

48
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,550
Boss, I've got those names for the
scientists who've worked with reptiles.

49
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,370
Good. Then you can
interview them for background.

50
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:51,500
Right. Closest one is at Empire State.
Name's Connors.

51
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,800
- Doctor Curt Connors?
<i>- You know him Peter?</i>

52
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,650
He's one of my teachers Mr. Robertson.

53
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,080
He's an expert in recombining DNA
and reptile mutagenics.

54
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,360
He's also a genius!

55
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,030
Yeah, yeah. Whatever.

56
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,240
You'll be the contact
with Connors from now on kid.

57
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,400
- But boss...
- The kid already knows him,

58
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,680
and besides, do you have any idea
what mutawhat's-it's are?

59
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,270
Uh...

60
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:14,290
Mr. Jameson I still think this whole
Lizard-thing is just a big hoax!

61
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,640
Parker! The first one
to get a photo of the Lizard

62
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,710
for my nightly news
gets a thousand dollar bonus.

63
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,490
Uh, colour or black and white?

64
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:32,020
A thousand dollars, I could
put it down on a new motorcycle.

65
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,280
Maybe a car! Wait 'til I tell Aunt May!

66
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,240
- Hey pretty lady! Why the frown?
- Nothing Peter, nothing at all.

67
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,140
I just... can't decide
what to make for dinner that's all.

68
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,610
Why does she always
keep things from me?

69
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,600
Look at these bills!

70
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,010
And here I am,
thinking of things to buy for myself.

71
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,230
She's been
like a mother to me for years!

72
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,340
It's time I paid her back.
And if I can't.

73
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,480
<i>It's a thousand dollar bonus.<i>

74
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,680
Spiderman will.

75
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,800
Just once I want an assignment
in some nice sunny suburb.

76
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,290
Huh anyway this lizard-thing
is probably just an urban myth.

77
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,680
Wait a minute!
Looks like I was <i>myth-taken</i>!

78
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,670
<i>- Peter!</i>
- Oh no. Not Deborah Whitman!

79
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,410
The little sister I never had...
or wanted.

80
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,500
Since when do you have night class?

81
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,450
In fact I've always thought of you
as having no class <i>at all</i>.

82
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,570
Nyuk nyuk.

83
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:38,320
It just so happens I've got
something to show Doc Connors.

84
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,300
- Oh, really? What?
- None of your... Hey!

85
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,260
Hmmm... Well that's interesting.

86
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,670
Obviously a reptilian
of the Squamata order.

87
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,170
But, look at the imprint
left by the heel!

88
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,240
It's an imprint. So?

89
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,490
Yes, but look how deep it is!

90
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,120
Lot of weight on it.

91
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,130
Well, maybe it's a very fat squamata!

92
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:02,210
Or maybe Peter, it walks on two legs!

93
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,360
- I knew that!
- You didn't... Hmph!

94
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,020
Shhh.

95
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,800
Something's wrong.

96
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,200
You're darn right,

97
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,590
you were suffocating me!

98
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,860
- Nice time for a brownout, eh?
- Uhh, no kidding.

99
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,010
The storm must be causing it.

100
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,780
Who's there? Who is it?

101
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,210
- No! Stay away!
- Dr. Connors? What's wrong?

102
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,990
- No, Deborah, wait!
- But it sounds like he needs help.

103
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,180
Aaaaah!

104
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,290
Peter!

105
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,230
Deborah!

106
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:49,510
Are you alright?

107
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,020
I got the wind knocked out of me.

108
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,830
What's that thing done to Doc Connors?

109
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,680
Stop! Come back!

110
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,320
Peter! Don't leave me here alone!

111
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,600
It's alright.

112
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:05,880
Everything's okay now

113
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:09,360
You were downright brave back there!

114
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,490
It was quite a surprise!

115
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,200
Why, Miss Whitman,
is that a compliment?

116
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,890
- From you?
- Don't push your luck, Peter!

117
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:22,270
What was that thing?
And why would it kidnap Dr. Connors?

118
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,840
<i>Dr. Connors, I'm ready to proceed.</i>

119
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,110
<i>Temperature alpha.</i>

120
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:41,960
Respiration alpha.

121
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:45,200
Life signs all
register normal, Dr. Connors.

122
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:50,640
If I'm right,
Mickey here is better than normal.

123
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,700
Hmm.

124
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:55,360
Look! Look! There it is!

125
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,010
A reptile's ability
to grow a new limb... <i>in a mammal</i>!

126
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:02,820
All because of a couple
of micrograms of reptile DNA,

127
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,850
and a neogenic recombinator!

128
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,750
- Incredible!
- No, Peter,

129
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,400
this is just the beginning.

130
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,830
When we do the same for human beings
when we can replace limbs

131
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:14,250
lost in accidents or during a war.

132
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,370
That would be incredible.

133
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,530
Why would anybody
want to kidnap Dr. Connors?

134
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,170
Mommy? Is daddy coming home?

135
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,140
I don't know, Billy, I... Aaaaah!

136
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,290
Stay away! Leave us alone!

137
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,950
Easy, Mrs. Connors!
I'm looking for the professor.

138
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:54,150
- No! I won't let you hurt my husband!
- Hurt him? I...

139
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:54,930
Noooo!

140
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,840
No! No! Please!

141
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,710
You're for real!
Just hold that pose, Smiley!

142
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:19,740
Whoa!

143
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:23,050
Great, there goes my 1000 dollar photo!

144
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:26,230
Bah. When am I gonna get the hang
of being a super-hero and

145
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,940
a photographer at the same time?

146
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,140
Good reflexes,
for a future handbag!

147
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,960
Now that you crawled out of your sewer,
maybe you'd better stick around.

148
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:44,080
Because I wanna know
what you did with Doc Connors

149
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,400
Now you're really making me mad!

150
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:07,800
- No daddy, stop!
- Billy...

151
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,330
"Daddy"?

152
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:17,580
Did I hear right?
Did he say "daddy"?

153
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,700
Yes. Yes that was Curt.
It all started with a device.

154
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,540
Curt called it
the "neogenic recombinator",

155
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,840
he used it on himself as an
experiment to make his arm grow again.

156
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,550
But it turned him into that...

157
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,170
that creature!

158
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,670
Why haven't you told anybody?
The police?

159
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,150
No! They'll think he's a freak!

160
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:47,540
They'll hunt him down and hurt him
...or worse.

161
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,450
I know how that goes.
But not If I can reach him first!

162
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,680
I'm so scared.

163
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,390
We'll keep this quiet,
as long as we can.

164
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,650
Uh-oh... We're not alone !

165
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,450
When I break this story
it'll be Pullitzer time!

166
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,080
Hang loose, Brock,

167
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,060
That webbing will melt
in a couple of hours.

168
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,040
- You can't do this!
- I already have!

169
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,040
I won't let you ruin Connors' life.

170
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:11,130
What, what!...

171
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,760
Mommy! Mommy!

172
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,760
Billy! Where's your mom?

173
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,510
Daddy came back and took her away!
Down here!

174
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,760
The sewers...

175
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,800
Listen, I'm gonna carry you to a
neighbors' house where you'll be safe,

176
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,380
then I'll go get your mom
and your dad too. OK?

177
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,090
OK,
but don't let anything happen to them.

178
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,660
Let me go! Let me go!

179
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:47,460
Ugh, what a slimy mess!

180
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,670
Why can't I be one of those
galaxy-helping superheroes?

181
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,770
Why do I end up in the sewers?

182
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:53,480
Ugh.

183
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,720
Whoa!

184
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,440
You don't find the Fantastic Four
in the sewer!

185
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,820
Or the Avengers!

186
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,250
Never have I seen the Avengers
in the sewer!

187
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,580
Or the Defenders!

188
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,740
Well, maybe the Hulk...

189
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,620
Quit griping, Parker.

190
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,280
You know what's really bothering you.
You're scared.

191
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,450
This Lizard creature is powerful
enough to tear you limb from limb!

192
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:22,670
But you can't even hurt him,
because trapped inside is your friend.

193
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,300
But I have to find him,
it's the only way to stop him!

194
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,400
..to save him!

195
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,610
Well isn't this the story of my life?

196
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:34,400
Put me down, stop!
No! Don't!

197
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,150
Gotta reach him fast.
Whoa! Not this fast!

198
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,900
Uh-oh, tilt.

199
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,520
Time to put on the brakes !

200
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,560
Argh. My webbing's
losing its consistency.

201
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,320
I better change cartridges soon.

202
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,310
The worst part of all this is,

203
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,880
I was the one who helped the
Doc with these experiments.

204
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,450
If it wasn't for me... Uh?

205
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,120
Save me! Save me!

206
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,090
The missing subway worker!

207
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:15,390
He's building some electrical thing,
he couldn't do it himself.

208
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:20,360
He needed my help, but I,
I got weak. No food, no sleep.

209
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,780
Aaaaaaaah!

210
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:28,540
- Hey, come back for me, ri-right?
- Hey, I'm the hero, remember?

211
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,500
*growls*

212
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,860
Why did you bring me here, Curt? Why?

213
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,820
- So we can be together.
- You're still my husband. I love you,

214
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,160
I want to be with you,
but not like this.

215
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:54,880
I... love you, too. I need you,
and I need your help, with this.

216
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:58,990
I need your hands to operate it for me.

217
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,550
Mine can't grasp.

218
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,820
The other human got weak, scared.

219
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:07,660
- What are you going to do with that?
- Don't be afraid, Margaret.

220
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,390
It'll transform you.

221
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:14,550
You'll be able to heal any wound.
Replace any limb.

222
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:17,460
First you, then everyone.

223
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,350
Once I connect the neogenic
recombinator to these

224
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:24,190
electrical conduits, I can reach
every home in the city!

225
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:28,810
Every man, woman and child!
I can transform all of them!

226
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:32,020
No more suffering, no more pain.

227
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:36,660
But Curt. After you transform everyone
we'll all be like you!

228
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:41,400
Of course. I'm the first of
a new race! A better race!

229
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,760
If you're so much better
why do you need my hands to help you?

230
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,720
You're not better.
Look what you've become!

231
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:53,480
No! You're twisting things!
I can make people well again.

232
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,080
And I won't stop for anything!

233
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,380
Not even for Billy?

234
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,550
- You want him to be like you too?
- My son... I have a son...

235
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,850
Sorry, Doc!

236
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:09,070
I'm doing this for Billy
as much as for you!

237
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,200
Oooh!

238
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,090
*growls*

239
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,240
His mind's all reptile now.

240
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,560
Mrs. Connors! Get away while you can!
He's dangerous!

241
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,670
No, don't touch that thing!

242
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,760
Mrs. Connors, run!

243
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,180
Aaah!

244
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,840
Oh, nooo.

245
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,050
Margaret. I'm sorry...

246
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,420
I'll only get one chance on this
or I'm lizard food.

247
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,380
Uh-oh! Jell time!

248
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,400
Curt...

249
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,790
Strange. So strange.

250
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,840
A week ago this creature
was a scientist.

251
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,110
My teacher. My friend.
He cared for people

252
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,180
and wanted to help them,
just as I do.

253
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,990
And now look at the both of us.

254
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,120
Fighting each other...
fighting for our lives!

255
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,640
Curt! Spider-man!

256
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,520
- Curt... Is he..?
- He'll be OK.

257
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,990
Ooh, thank heaven!

258
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,770
I'll help you carry him
out of here in a second.

259
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,810
But first I have to get something.

260
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:18,190
A thousand dollar photo!
Not too shabby.

261
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,880
And what's Eddie Brock
going to end up with?

262
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,890
An exclusive story
nobody's ever going to believe!

263
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,320
I tell you, JJ,
the Lizard is Curt Connors.

264
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,170
I would have had you out here earlier,
but Spiderman webbed me.

265
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,420
Dr. Connors is
a respected scientist, Brock.

266
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:34,610
And Peter Parker already
brought me photos of the Lizard

267
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:35,520
early this morning.

268
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,460
But I'll show you the Lizard himself!

269
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,690
- You better be right about this.
- Boss, if I'm wrong, I'll...

270
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,900
I'll, I'll eat today's issue of Bugle.

271
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:46,190
J. Jonah Jameson.
What brings you here this morning?

272
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,770
You want it cooked or raw?

273
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,860
Peter, where did you get this?

274
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,180
I sold an exclusive
photo to The Daily Bugle.

275
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,460
- Oh, dear.
- What's wrong?

276
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,550
Exactly how did you happen
to get this picture?

277
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,100
Well.. I...

278
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,320
- No hemming and hawing.
- Aunt May, I-I..

279
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,320
You followed Spider-man
into the sewer, didn't you?

280
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,480
Yeah...right.

281
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,710
It's cold and damp down there!

282
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,490
You probably got germs
incubating even as we speak.

283
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:24,770
You need some hot soup
and a good long rest.

284
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,630
A nice boy like you,
taking pictures in a sewer!

285
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,280
And what if that
horrible Spiderman had caught you?

286
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,840
Aunt May... She'd never understand.

287
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,110
Spider-man's already
caught me in his web.

288
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:40,220
And for better or worse
he and I are stuck together, forever.
